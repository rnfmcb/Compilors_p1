//Program Translation project 1
//This is the main file for project 1. 
//This project will implement a token as a triplet {tokenID, tokenInstance, line#} (if doing option with line numbers)
//Dont forget EOFtk token
//Implement the scanner in a separate file with basename "scanner"
//For testing purposes, the scanner will be tested using a testing driver implemented in file with basename "testScanner". You need to implement your own tester and include as a part of the project. The tester will call for one token at a time and display the token to the screen one per line, including information (descriptive) on what token class, what token instance, and what line, if applicable.
